## Instructions

The goal of the Classic Arcade Game is to successfully move your character to the water without being hit by a bug!

Each time the player successfully reaches the water or is hit by a bug the Successes and Fails counters will update, respectively.

The game defaults on Medium difficulty. Players can decrease difficulty by clicking on Easy, or increase difficulty by clicking on Hard.

Players can also select one of the five available characters by clicking their picture.

Play the game by cloning the project [here](https://github.com/jadgowen/gowen-arcade-game.git), then opening the index.html file in the browser of your choice.
